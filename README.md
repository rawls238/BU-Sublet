This is just some code I wrote while procrastinating for my differential equations and econometrics midterms and finals. In total, 
it is meant to be a site for making the subletting process simple and seamless for students at Boston University. However, because
it was written in the context stated above, I didn't put much effort towards good coding style or, even, much of any comments. Hopefully, however,
someone finds this code useful for something.

P.S. Also something I figured out after I wrote this code - store the geocoded lat and lng of your addresses in the database so you don't have 
to continually call google map's geocode function and make life hard on yourself and your servers! I know this is common practice, but 
I failed to figure that out until after I was almost done (don't know why).
